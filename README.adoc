= Nairobi Bus Stops App

React leaflet starter front-end web application for visualizing locations of bus stops in the Nairobi central business
district. A simple app demonstrating capabilities of Web geographic information systems (GIS) and building blocks of large
and complex maps and dashboards.

== Folder structure

The source code for the front-end is in the link:src/[`src`] folder. Below is the folder structure of the app.

== Testing

== Routing

== Linting

ESLint and Prettier are set up and should work out of the box.

=== Formatting

== Notes

Depending on your development environment set up, you might need to install the
link:https://pnpm.io/[`pnpm`] packages locally (it can help your editor with autocompletion and
linting):

[source,bash]
----
# From the project root
cd nairobi-busstops-client
pnpm install
----

You should now have the packages installed locally to `node_modules`
and you should be able to run `npm` scripts locally (not through Docker):

[source,bash]
----
pnpm run dev
----
